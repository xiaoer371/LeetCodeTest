 ======================      question1    ================================

 Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

 Example:
 
 Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
 
 Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
 return [0, 1].
 
 ======================      question2     ================================
 
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
 The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
 Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
 Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 
 ======================      question3     ================================
 
 Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
